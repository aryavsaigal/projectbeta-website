            BetaTest is a cryptic hunt, the schools have to make their way
            through multiple levels to reach the top of the leaderboard.

        <li>
          <p>
            Not all levels are equal, some might be worth more points than
            others, the winner is decided by the points, not the level.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Each level will contain a question either in the form of text or a
            link or an image. Hints (text/link/image) may be provided as well to
            help the participant.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Besides, hints will be released on our official social media, most
            notably our Discord server. It's highly recommended that you join
            it.

          <p>
            Answers will always be lower-case, alphanumeric and will contain no
            spaces. Special characters are not allowed. For example, if the
            answer is "Lxy giu /(.*)?/", you would type it in as “lxygiu”.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Every clue in the question is important. If it wasn't important, it
            wouldn't be there.
          </p>

            Do not spam admins or other participants, it may lead to your
            disqualification.

            And if it was not obvious, team play, answer sharing, hint sharing
            and collaborating with other competitors in general is not allowed
            and any such evidence can lead to disqualification.

*   Beyond the given time frame the questions will not be repeated as the quiz is time bound to test speed and accuracy.
    
*   A google form will be shared with the participants in which they must write the answers against the question numbers. \[note that the questions will only be shown on the slide and not be available on the google form.

Within the final round, in the first half participants would be allocated one question to answer which may be passed due to inability of a team to answer.

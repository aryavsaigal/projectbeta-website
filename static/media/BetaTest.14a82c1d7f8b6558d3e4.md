*   The hunt will begin on 9th August 2022 at 00:00:00 hours and will conclude on 10th August at 11:59:59 hours.
    
*   BetaTest is a cryptic hunt, the schools have to make their way through multiple levels to reach the top of the leaderboard.
    
*   Not all levels are equal, some might be worth more points than others, the winner is decided by the points, not the level.
    
*   Each level will contain a question either in the form of text or a link or an image. Hints (text/link/image) may be provided as well to help the participant.
    
*   Besides, hints will be released on our official social media, most notably our Discord server. It's highly recommended that you join it.
    
*   Answers will always be lower-case, alphanumeric and will contain no spaces. Special characters are not allowed. For example, if the answer is "Lxy giu /(.\*)?/", you would type it in as “lxygiu”.
    
*   Every clue in the question is important. If it wasn't important, it wouldn't be there.
    
*   Beware of the spelling you enter, we do not autocorrect.
    
*   Do not spam admins or other participants, it may lead to your disqualification.
    
*   And if it was not obvious, team play, answer sharing, hint sharing and collaborating with other competitors in general is not allowed and any such evidence can lead to disqualification.

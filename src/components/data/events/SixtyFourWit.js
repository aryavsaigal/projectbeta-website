            The quiz will be conducted via two rounds, the preliminary round
            would be online over google meet. On the google meet, the event
            heads will be presenting slides with questions on them for a set
            amount of time, after which they will move on to the next slide with
            the next question.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>

            Beyond the given time frame the questions will not be repeated as
            the quiz is time bound to test speed and accuracy.
          </p>
        </li>

          <p>
            A google form will be shared with the participants in which they
            must write the answers against the question numbers. [note that the
            questions will only be shown on the slide and not be available on
            the google form]

            Finals would be an offline event wherein participants would be
            expected to answer the questions which would be read aloud by the
            event heads. Within the final round, in the first half participants
            would be allocated one question to answer which may be passed due to
            inability of a team to answer. <br /> <br />
            The second half would function off a buzzer system, wherein the
            participants answer on a first cum basis
